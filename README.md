## General Information
This project/case study is about helping a Consumer Finanace Company to identify the pattern of defaulters of the loan that the institution has given.
Depending on the pattern, the institution would like to make decisions about either providing a loan or rejecting it to certain clients that may seem to 
fall in this pattern of defaulting.

The business problem that this study is intending to solve is to provide enough information to the institution th ehelp them make decisions for loan approval.
Effectively, the institution should be able to decide if the applicant will be able to replay the loan or not. 

For this purpose, the dataset used for analysis contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted or not. Studying this dataset would provide insights into the pattern of defaulters.
