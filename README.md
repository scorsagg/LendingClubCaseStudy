In this case study, we plan to apply our knowledge of EDA into use and understand risk analytics in banking and financial services.
It is intended to showcase how data is analyzed to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## General Information
This project/case study is about helping a Consumer Finanace Company to identify the pattern of defaulters of the loan that the institution has given.
Depending on the pattern, the institution would like to make decisions about either providing a loan or rejecting it to certain clients that may seem to 
fall in this pattern of defaulting.

The business problem that this study is intending to solve is to provide enough information to the institution th ehelp them make decisions for loan approval.
Effectively, the institution should be able to decide if the applicant will be able to replay the loan or not. 

For this purpose, the dataset used for analysis contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted or not. Studying this dataset would provide insights into the pattern of defaulters.

Some of the attributes are
• Number of years of employment at the time of receiving
the loan
• The debt-to-income ratio of the applicant
• The purpose of taking the loan
• Study the pattern of the other attributes against the loans
that were charged-off.

## Conclusions
- This number of employees with tenure more than 8 years are the most applicants and in need of the loan.
- The bivariate analysis complements the univariate analysis that the most applicants with charged-off loans are in the employment range 8 – 10 years.
- The heat maps show the main purpose and the amount taken as loan that constitute the applicants whose loans were charged-off.
- The Grade of the loan does not play a part in the defaulting pattern.
